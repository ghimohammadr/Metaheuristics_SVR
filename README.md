# Metaheuristics_SVR
A Matlab implementation of paper "Forecasting stock market with support vector regression and butterfly optimization algorithm" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11462).

The performance of SVR models highly depends upon the appropriate choice of SVR parameters. Here, different metaheuristic algorithms are used to tune the hyperparameters.
